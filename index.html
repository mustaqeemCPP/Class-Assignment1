            <h2>A LITTLE ABOUT ME</h2>
            <p>Hi, my name is Toheeb  Obayemi, a front-end student at the on-going 20234/2024 AltSchool Africa Bootcamp.</p>
            <p>Looking back, i have always been curious about how things works generally. My first encounter with a computer
                machine was a terrible one. I knew there and then that i wanted to learn how computer works. Learning how to code has been one of the most amazing things i have tried out.</p>

            <p>Looking back, i have always been curious about how things works generally. My first encounter with a computer
                machine was a terrible one. I knew there and then that i wanted to learn how computer works. Learning how to code has been one of the most amazing things i have tried out.</p>
                <p>I heard about Altschool on X app, formerly known as Twitter and  I have read some really positive reviews from past students and mentors about the school. I just knew it then that i had to get on the AltSchool train. I have been on the school Twitter page since last year checking for when they would take in new students.</p>
                <p>My Altschool student ID is ALT/SOE/023/3682 and I am excited to be part of this amazing experience.</p>

            <h2>MY PLANS</h2>
            <p>I would so much love to fully understand why and how computer codes works. I am looking forward to becoming a very good software engineer providing solutions to day to day problems through codes. So help me God.</p>
